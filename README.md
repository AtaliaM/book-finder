# ðŸ“˜ Book Finder ðŸ“˜
A React app I built, where you can search for a book title/author name, and I'll present
you relevant titles from Google Books API.ðŸ˜Š 
I've implemented a continuous deployment workflow using git actions. Any code push to main triggers a deployment script directly to netlify: 
# https://bookfinderz.netlify.app/

Hope you enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
