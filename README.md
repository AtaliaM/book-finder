# ðŸ“˜ Book Finder ðŸ“˜
A React app I built, where you can search for a book title/author name, and I'll present
you relevant titles from Google Books API.ðŸ˜Š 
If you search for a term that has no results from the API you'll get a message indicating that, and your last successful search results will still be displayed to you.
I've implemented a continuous deployment workflow using git actions. Any code push to main triggers a deployment script directly to netlify:

Hope you enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
